The neuron's resting potential sits near **-70 mV**, held by the sodium-potassium pump.

## Today

- [x] Resting potential recap
- [ ] Depolarization and the Na+ channel cascade
- [ ] Why myelin makes conduction fast

| Phase | Channel | Direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Depolarize | Na+ opens | inward |
| Repolarize | K+ opens | outward |

The membrane potential follows:

$$V_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\frac{[K^+]_{out}}{[K^+]_{in}}$$

\`\`\`python
tau = 2.0  # membrane time constant, ms
v = -70.0
for step in range(3):
    v += (0 - v) / tau
    print(round(v, 1))

    faqMarkdown: `# FAQ

## Is it really free?

Yes, completely free for personal use.

## Where are my notes stored?

Locally, as files on your machine. Optional GitHub sync if you want them in a repo you control.

## Do I need an account?

No. Myelin Notes has no account system at all: you download it, open it, and your notes are on your disk. You sign in with GitHub only if you turn on GitHub sync, and that is your account with GitHub, not one with us.

## Is it open source?

Not quite. The source is public, so anyone can read it and check what the app does with their notes, and it is free to use for personal and other noncommercial purposes. It is licensed under PolyForm Strict 1.0.0, which means you cannot redistribute it or publish modified versions, and commercial use needs a separate license.

## Can I collaborate with others?

Yes, live and peer to peer, today. There is no Myelin account and nothing sitting in the middle. Devices find each other through GitHub sync, so both ends need access to the same repo. Shared notebooks with permissions arrive in v1.0.

## Can I import from another app?

Yes. Myelin imports an Obsidian vault, a OneNote .onepkg notebook or .one section, a Goodnotes folder exported as PDFs, loose Markdown, PDFs, images, and video, and a workspace folder exported from Myelin itself. Notion comes across through its own Markdown and CSV export, which the file importer reads; a dedicated Notion importer that keeps the page hierarchy is on the roadmap.

## Does it work offline?

Fully. Editing, full-text and semantic search, handwriting recognition, audio transcription, PDF annotation, and export all run on your own machine, so the app behaves identically with the network off. Only GitHub sync and live collaboration need a connection, and both are optional.

## What about iPhone, iPad, and Android?

Coming soon. Today Myelin Notes runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. The mobile apps are in development, and they are native builds rather than a cut-down viewer: the same notes, the same canvas, and the same sync as the desktop apps, with Apple Pencil on iPad and an S Pen or active stylus on Android.
